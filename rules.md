# Rule Variations

## Suicide Kings (Nuke)
The King of Hearts is the so-called suicide king as his sword appears to be going through his head.

An optional rule variation is to use the Suicide King(s) as a nuke that kills all opponent pegs in play.

This option is generally only used while playing with the rager deck variation.
