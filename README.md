# Rules

## The board

The Wampoo board has holes drilled to accept standard cribbage pegs.

The home area for a player starts 2 pegs behind his spawn.

There are 16 pegs between each player's spawn.

The wampoo board has three areas. 
- Staging
- In Play
- Home

### Staging
Staging is an area off the play board where pieces sit initially and return to if the peg s 'killed'.

This is a holding area while you wait to get your pegs on the board, or 'In Play'

### In Play
When a piece is brought out it is now 'in play' an can move and be 'killed' by other players.

### Home
When a piece is moved into the home area it is safe and can never move out.
